## Where This Fits in With Everything Else

* check out the [schedule](../../schedule.html)
* we're doing about 3 weeks of JavaScript
* last week, we covered a bunch of super basic stuff (a bit of a drag, I know)
* this week, we're starting some of the _fun stuff_ - like functional and object oriented programming

## Concerned About Not Knowing HTML/CSS?

Here are some resources.

* [Learn to Code HTML & CSS by Shay Howe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) by Shay Howe
* [HTML Dog](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/)
* [Codecademy: Make a Website](http://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-a-website) by Codecademy

<br>
All are __free__ and __online__ ... and relatively compact!

You'll have some time to learn this, as we won't need any front-end development _at all_ for about a month.

## First Homework is Up

[Homework #1](../../assignments.html#hw01) will help you get familiar with JavaScript syntax.

* __create a github account with your nyu net id__ 
	* (it may make sense to keep this separate from your _actual_ github account)
	* (all of your assignments will be private)
* try a few exercises from {{ site.book_js }}
* blackjack (yeah, you've probably done this before)
	* using the  _synchronous_ prompt library to simulate a browser prompt. (__you know, browser prompt__)
	* (note that node.js programs would usually use a different prompt library that's asynchronous) 
	* my implementation isn't that long (just over 100 LOC)
* should be completely posted by this afternoon
